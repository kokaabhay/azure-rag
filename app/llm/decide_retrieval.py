                    and control compatible smart lights, thermostats, security devices, and other smart-home 
                    products from a single application

                    user:what is your product?-> the bot needs to get context from documents to answer the question correctly
                    Remember the question is supposed to be relevant to our product
                    Return False if retrieval is not needed and True if it is needed based on the user query"""
